# The Meal Generator

## Description

The Meal Generator is intended to take the uncertainty and guesswork out of planning a meal. It provides the indecisive or bored home cook with fresh recipe ideas drawn from two APIs, encompassing a main course, a dessert, and a cocktail selected in accordance with the user's selected preferences. In building it we navigated questions of how to retrieve the desired data from APIs, how to populate the results in clear and intuitive manner, and how to save and organize the user's preferences with local storage.

## Usage

The user can generate a random meal suggestion by selecting categories from the two dropdowns: options for what type of meal they're looking for, and whether they would prefer an alcoholic or non-alcoholic cocktail. They click the submit button and their meal suggestion renders to the page: ingredients and steps for a main course, a dessert, and a cocktail. If they like a recipe, they can click the save button for that recipe. These are saved to local storage, and appear in a list that will remain for future site visits. They can click on any recipe name in their saved list and view the recipe ingredients and steps again.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md

    ```
